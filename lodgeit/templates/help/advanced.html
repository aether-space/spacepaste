    If you are looking at a paste you can toggle the paste detail
    box by clicking on "paste detail". From there you have (depending on
    the type of paste) a couple of options:{% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <img src="/static/help/advanced_features.png" class="standalone" alt="{% trans %}screenshot of the paste detail box{% endtrans %}">
  <p>{% trans %}
    In any case you can reply to that paste by clicking on the
    "reply to this paste" link. Also always possible is downloading the
    paste, changing the color scheme and toggeling the line numbers.{% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <p>{% trans %}
    If the paste you're looking at is a reply to another paste you can
    compare it with the parent paste by clicking on the "compare it with
    parent paste" link. If this paste has pastes that replied to you will
    see a list of replies in the detail box.{% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <p>{% trans %}
    Even if someone copied over the paste by hand to make changes you can
    still compare those two pastes if you enter the id of the other paste
    into the textfield and click compare.{% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <p>{% trans %}
    If you want to see all pastes that are somehow related to the current
    one, click on the "show paste tree" link:{% endtrans %}

  <h3>{% trans %}Comparing Pastes{% endtrans %}</h3>
  <p>{% trans %}
    In the diff view you can see the differences between two pastes. Deleted
    lines have a redish background, added lines a bright green one. You can
    also download the changes as unified diff.{% endtrans %}

  <h3>{% trans %}Paste Notifications{% endtrans %}</h3>
  <p>{% trans %}
    If someone replies to one of your pastes you will get a notification the
    next time you visit the pastebin. This however doesn't work for pastes
    older than 31 days because after that time you get a new cookie for
    privacy reasons.{% endtrans %}
  </p>
  <h3>{% trans %}Multi-File Pastes{% endtrans %}</h3>
  <p>{% trans %}
    If you select the "Multi-File" formatter from the list you can combine
    multiple files into one paste.  Each file has to be introduced with a
    formatter line of the following format:
  {% endtrans %}</p>
  <pre class="sample">{{ _('### filename [formatter key]') }}</pre>
  <p>{% trans %}
    Both the filename and the formatter key is optional.  If no formatter
    key is provided the formatter is guessed from the filename.  If the
    filename is given it will be used as headline for the section.
  {% endtrans %}</p>
  <p>{{ _('The list of formatters is on the bottom of this page.') }}</p>
  <h3>{{ _('Formatter Preselection') }}</h3>
  <p>{% trans %}
    If you want to use lodgeit on your project's IRC channel you can add
    <code>+FORMATTER</code> to the URL where <code>FORMATTER</code> is the
    name of the formatter to select from the list below:
  {% endtrans %}</p>
  <h3>{{ _('Supported Formatters') }}</h3>
  <table>
    <tr><th>{{ _('Key') }}</th><th>{{ _('Name') }}</th></tr>
    {%- for key, name in formatters|dictsort(true, 'value') %}
      <tr><td><code>{{ key }}</code></td><td>{{ name }}</td></tr>
    {%- endfor %}
  </table>
